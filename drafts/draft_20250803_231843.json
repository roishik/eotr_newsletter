Using EEG headsets to track brain activity, combined with linguistic analysis and post-writing interviews, the team observed 54 students over multiple essay-writing sessions.\n\nThree groups were studied:\n\nLLM group: used ChatGPT only\n\nSearch group: used Google but no AI\n\nBrain-only group: wrote using just their own minds\n\nA surprise twist in session 4 flipped the setup: ChatGPT users had to write without it, and vice versa.\n\nKey Discoveries\n\ud83e\udde9 1. Using ChatGPT feels easy\u2014but your brain might disengage.\nEEG data showed that participants relying on ChatGPT had the weakest brain network activity during writing. Their cognitive load was lower, but so was engagement\u2014especially in the alpha and beta bands associated with attention and memory.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 2. Brain-only writers stayed sharp.\nParticipants writing without help had the strongest, most widespread brain connectivity. They were more likely to remember and accurately quote their essays and felt the strongest sense of ownership.\n\n\ud83d\udd01 3. ChatGPT use has a lingering effect.\nWhen LLM users were asked to write without help (Session 4), their brains didn\u2019t fully bounce back. Their connectivity remained low, and they struggled with memory recall\u2014suggesting a potential \u201ccognitive debt\u201d from prolonged AI reliance.\n\nSo What?\nWhile ChatGPT can make writing faster and smoother, this study reveals a hidden cost: it may reduce your cognitive effort, engagement, and even your ability to recall or feel ownership over your own words. The ease comes at a price\u2014possibly at the expense of learning itself.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you\u2019re using AI to write, ask yourself: Is it helping you learn, or just helping you finish?\n\n\"\"\"",

        "Windshield View": "**Are AI Tools Eroding Our Cognitive Muscles?**\n\nHere's a fascinating conundrum from researchers at MIT and Wellesley: while AI tools like ChatGPT can streamline our writing tasks, what are they actually doing to our brains? This study peeled back the layers on how different writing methods\u2014whether with AI, traditional search engines, or our trusty noggins\u2014impact our cognitive engagement, memory, and sense of ownership.\n\nImagine wearing an EEG headset while drafting an essay, your brain activity under the microscope. That's exactly what 54 students did. The results? Those using ChatGPT showed the least brain activity, especially in areas linked to attention and memory. It seems the ease of AI comes with a catch: reduced cognitive engagement and a diminished sense of ownership over one's work. Interestingly, those who relied solely on their mental faculties exhibited stronger brain connectivity and a sharper recall of their writing.\n\nThe twist in the study was a real eye-opener: ChatGPT users, when suddenly deprived of AI support, struggled to bounce back in brain engagement and memory recall. This suggests a \"cognitive debt\" from prolonged AI reliance. It poses a critical question for all of us embracing AI: Are we nurturing our brains or merely coasting through tasks? As we integrate these tools into our lives, it's worth pondering their impact on our learning and intellectual growth.",

NVIDIA stands out, with 89% of its Q1 2026 revenue rooted in data centers, driven by the AI boom that's been churning since 2024. Apple, while still riding high on iPhone sales at 47% in Q3 2025, is making noticeable strides in services, which now make up 29% of its revenue, reflecting a pivot toward sustainable income. Microsoft showcases balance, with 43% of its Q4 2025 revenue derived from Azure and cloud services, underscoring its strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Meanwhile, Google remains heavily dependent on ads, at 56%, but faces an intriguing challenge: how AI Overview might reshape or disrupt its substantial $237.86 billion ad revenue stream.\n\n- **Why It Matters:** These shifts highlight how the tech titans are navigating the ever-evolving digital landscape, each betting on different horses. NVIDIA's data center dominance underscores the central role of AI in future tech infrastructure. Apple's growing services sector signals a strategic diversification to buffer against hardware fluctuations. Microsoft's emphasis on cloud solutions reflects the increasing demand for robust AI capabilities, positioning itself against competitors like Google. Speaking of Google, its reliance on ads suggests vulnerability to AI-driven changes, potentially redefining its business model. The subtle whisper of Chinese companies rising hints at a shifting global power dynamic, with their market cap growing alongside China's consumer market influence.\n\n- **What I Think:** It's fascinating to see these giants adapting to rapid technological changes, each with its own strategy. NVIDIA's leap into AI is both bold and necessary, given the industry's trajectory. Apple's service shift feels like a natural evolution, one that could sustain its leadership long-term. Microsoft's focus on cloud solutions is astute, providing flexibility and strength in an AI-centric world. Google's ad dependency, however, seems like an Achilles' heel, especially with AI's potential to upend conventional models. And let's not overlook the quiet storm brewing in China; their tech companies could soon redefine the competitive landscape, challenging the established order and introducing new dynamics. The future is indeed an intriguing tapestry of possibilities!",
        "The Next Lane": "**The Startup Saga Shaking the Tech Titans**\n\nHold on to your keyboards, because the Windsurf story is one for the tech history books. In just 72 hours, the coding startup managed to draw three major players into a bidding frenzy, leaving us with some juicy insights into the current state of tech warfare. Picture this: a small startup with 250 employees and a $100 million annual revenue run (ARR) becomes the center of a $5.4 billion whirlwind. OpenAI, Google, and Cognition, each with their own play, have highlighted a growing trend where talent and digital assets are the new battleground.\n\nFirst, OpenAI made a $3 billion bid for Windsurf, only to watch it slip through their fingers when the offer expired. Google, not missing a beat, swooped in with $2.4 billion, pulling off a clever reverse acqui-hire. Instead of buying the company, they snagged the CEO and co-founder, along with licensing the technology. But this left the rest of the Windsurf crew on the table, setting the stage for the final act.\n\nEnter Cognition, a lesser-known startup that managed to outmaneuver the giants. They acquired the remaining Windsurf assets, including the 250 employees, in a move that\u2019s being hailed as a masterstroke. By securing the entire customer base and product line, along with complete IP ownership, Cognition turned a potential loss into a substantial gain. It\u2019s a vivid reminder of how quickly fortunes can change and the sheer unpredictability of the tech landscape. This saga isn\u2019t just about big numbers and high stakes; it\u2019s a testament to the power dynamics of talent, innovation, and strategic insight shaping the future of tech."

With this milestone, WeRide becomes the world's only company to hold autonomous vehicle licenses across six countries\u2014Saudi Arabia, China, the UAE, Singapore, France, and the United States.\n\nThe license grants WeRide the authority to operate its autonomous vehicles throughout Saudi Arabia, marking a major step toward nationwide deployment of its Robotaxi service. The pilot phase has already launched in Riyadh, in partnership with Uber and local tech firm AiDriver.\n\n\u5fae\u4fe1\u56fe\u7247_20250729164852.png\n\nPhoto credit: WeRide\n\nThe pilot program began earlier this month, covering key locations in Riyadh including King Khalid International Airport, major highways, and designated downtown areas. Full-scale commercial Robotaxi operations in Riyadh, jointly run by Uber and WeRide, are slated for launch by the end of 2025.\n\nThe official license approval was granted during Saudi Arabia's inaugural Robotaxi pilot launch event last week, signaling the green light for commercial autonomous mobility services in the Kingdom.\n\nWeRide said it is the first autonomous driving company whose Robotaxi has passed through the regulatory sandbox program overseen by Saudi Arabia's Transport General Authority (\"TGA\"). Securing the license required extensive vetting by multiple government agencies, including rigorous testing, evaluation, and technology validation to ensure maximum safety and performance standards. The regulatory sandbox allows companies to trial new technologies within a monitored environment before full commercial rollout.\n\nThe recent licensing milestone follows WeRide's formal entry into the Saudi market in May. Beyond Robotaxi services, the company has also deployed its Robobus in several Saudi locations, including King Fahad Medical City, the Aramco residential compound, AlUla, and the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh.\n\nWeRide's autonomous street-sweeping vehicle, the S1, is also in operation at King Fahad Medical City and the Riyadh Second Health Cluster. This marks the Middle East's first commercial deployment of autonomous sanitation services.\n\nMeanwhile, WeRide is accelerating its broader Middle East expansion. In Abu Dhabi, the company is currently conducting the region's first fully driverless Robotaxi trials, with plans to extend service to Dubai in the near future.\n",
