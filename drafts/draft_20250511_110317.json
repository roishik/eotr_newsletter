    "nextlane_notes": "One Weird Trick for Better Reasoning\n \n\nResearchers showed that supervised fine-tuning on as few as 1,000 examples can enable a pretrained large language model to reason \u2014 and a clever gambit can boost its performance to rival that of top reasoning models.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s new: Niklas Muennighoff, Zitong Yang, Weijia Shi, Xiang Lisa Li and colleagues at Stanford, University of Washington, Allen Institute for AI, and Contextual AI developed s1, a reasoning model that achieves higher performance by producing more reasoning tokens. The authors forced the model to generate \u201cWait\u201d \u2014 as in, \"Wait, there may be a better way to go about this\u201d \u2014 to make it continue, rather than end, its reasoning process.\n\n\nKey insight: The sequence of reasoning tokens generated by a reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1 is delimited by special tokens. In pretraining on human data, a model learns to keep generating reasoning tokens until it generates the special token that ends the sequence. In addition, since people tend to revise their statements after writing \u201cWait\u201d, the model learns to do this as well. Thus, the reasoning process can be extended by appending the token for \u201cWait\u201d to the model\u2019s output periodically. In this way, when the output-in-progress is fed back to generate the next token, the model continues to reason over the prompt. Such extended reasoning can improve the final output by inducing the model to double-check its response so far and improve previous reasoning steps.\n\n \n\nHow it works: The authors fine-tuned a pretrained Qwen 2.5-32B, which does not produce reasoning tokens, on around 1,000 examples of chain-of-thought reasoning.\n\nTo build a fine-tuning dataset, the authors gathered roughly 59,000 questions and answers from 16 sources. The sources included math problems from NuminaMath and AIME and questions from OlympicArena on astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, geography, mathematics, and physics. They also included standardized test questions from SAT and LSAT via AGIEval.\nThey removed  examples with formatting issues (such as references to images that were missing) and questions that Qwen2.5-7B or Qwen2.5-32B could already solve. Then Gemini Flash Thinking generated a chain of thought for each remaining example. Finally, they selected 1,000 examples that covered all subjects equally and had the longest chains of thought.\nThey fine-tuned the model to generate the next token.\nTo control the number of reasoning tokens generated, at inference, the authors forced the model to either stop the process or extend it by replacing the end-reasoning token with one for \u201cWait\u201d, after which the model continued.\nResults: s1\u2019s performance improved as the number of reasoning tokens it generated increased. Ultimately, it achieved comparable performance to OpenAI o1-preview but fell short of o1.\n\nOn AIME 2024, s1 achieved 50.0 percent accuracy without forcing it to continue reasoning. When forced to continue reasoning twice, its accuracy rose to 53.3 percent. When forced four times, it reached 56.7 percent accuracy, between o1-preview (44.6 percent accuracy) and o1 (74.4 percent accuracy).\nOn MATH 500, s1 started at 92.6 percent accuracy. Forced to continue once, it reached 92.8 percent accuracy. Forced twice it reached 93.0 percent accuracy, higher than o1-preview (85.5 percent accuracy) but lower than o1 (94.8 percent accuracy). When forced four times, s1\u2019s performance fell to 92.2 percent accuracy. The authors don\u2019t offer a hypothesis to explain the decline.\nWhy it matters: A conventional pretrained LLM can learn to reason after supervised fine-tuning on as few as 1,000 curated examples \u2014 no reinforcement learning necessary. While some model builders don\u2019t disclose how they optimize reasoning, this work reveals that a strategy as simple as appending \u201cWait\u201d can be effective.\n\n \n\nWe\u2019re thinking: Wait, how can we apply this to our projects?",

        "Windshield View": "The latest strategic pivot by General Motors away from its autonomous vehicle technology company, Cruise, has resulted in a second round of layoffs at its Israeli branch. This decision highlights the ongoing challenges in the autonomous vehicle industry, where even major players like GM are reevaluating their positions. The hurdles these companies face aren't just technical but also involve regulatory, safety, and market acceptance issues that continue to complicate the path to fully autonomous driving.\n\nFrom my perspective, GM's move is a reminder of the complexity and unpredictability in the evolution of autonomous technology. It's not just about having cutting-edge technology; it's about navigating a landscape that's still very much in flux. The layoffs in Israel underscore the broader industry reality that big names are not immune to setbacks. This could serve as a catalyst for other companies to reassess their strategies, potentially fostering more collaboration and innovation as they seek viable routes to market.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this shake-up could spark a new wave of creativity and problem-solving in the industry. Companies may need to think more about partnerships, alternative business models, or incremental advancements rather than aiming straight for fully autonomous solutions. It's a pivotal moment that invites all of us in the field to rethink our approaches and possibly find new ways to tackle the challenges that lie ahead.",

        "The Next Lane": "In the ever-evolving field of AI, researchers from institutions like Stanford, the University of Washington, and the Allen Institute for AI have introduced a novel approach to enhance reasoning in large language models. By fine-tuning a pretrained model on as few as 1,000 examples, they discovered that inserting a simple \u201cWait\u201d token can significantly extend the reasoning process. This clever trick allows the model to pause and potentially reassess its output, mirroring how humans often reconsider their thoughts when they hit a conceptual snag.\n\nThis research highlights the power of a seemingly minor adjustment: the \u201cWait\u201d token prompts the model to continue its reasoning rather than concluding prematurely. This method essentially instructs the model to generate more reasoning tokens, therefore encouraging a deeper analytical process. By doing so, the model's performance can match that of leading reasoning models, achieving impressive accuracy in various test scenarios. This is a fascinating development because it suggests that enhancing AI reasoning doesn't always require complex, resource-intensive solutions but can sometimes be achieved through simple, strategic modifications.\n\nThe experiments showed that the performance of their model, dubbed s1, improved with the number of reasoning tokens generated. On challenging datasets like AIME 2024 and MATH 500, s1 demonstrated significant gains in accuracy simply by forcing it to \u201cwait\u201d and reconsider its reasoning steps. This approach not only pushes the boundaries of AI capabilities but also opens up new possibilities for enhancing decision-making processes across diverse applications.\n\nIt's interesting to think about how this approach to AI reasoning mirrors human mental models. Just as we might pause to reconsider our thoughts, the AI learns to do the same by appending \"Wait\" to its reasoning process. This similarity suggests that the principles of human reasoning can be effectively applied to AI models, offering a new lens through which to understand and develop artificial intelligence. By leveraging these parallels, we can continue to advance AI systems that better emulate human-like thought and decision-making."
