        "Windshield View": "Let me take you on a journey into the buzzing world of robotaxis\u2014a realm where the lines between science fiction and reality are blurring faster than ever. We stand at a crossroads in the autonomous vehicle industry, with companies like Tesla and Waymo vying for dominance in the burgeoning robotaxi market. But here's the kicker: will this be a \"winner takes all\" scenario, or are we looking at a more fragmented landscape where multiple players coexist and thrive?\n\nTesla, with its audacious vision and relentless innovation, is pushing hard to become the leader in autonomous ride-hailing. Yet, the path to supremacy is not without its hurdles. Competitors like Waymo, with their deep-pocketed backing and rigorous testing, aren't just sitting idly by. They're paving their own routes in this high-stakes game, each with unique strategies that could redefine urban mobility as we know it. Meanwhile, traditional automotive giants like Volkswagen are also throwing their hats into the ring, eager to stake their claims in this rapidly evolving market.\n\nWhat fascinates me most is the broader implication of this technological race. Are we on the brink of a new era where a single company could monopolize our streets, or will diverse ecosystems of autonomous vehicles emerge, each serving different needs and niches? As we ponder this, let's keep our minds open to the myriad possibilities that the future holds. The outcome will not only reshape how we move but could also redefine our cities and the very fabric of society.",

        "The Next Lane": "The race for AI supremacy is heating up to unprecedented levels, as highlighted by Meta's jaw-dropping move to lure top talent from OpenAI with $100 million signing bonuses. This isn't just a typical corporate tug-of-war; it's a full-blown talent arms race in the AI world. Academic institutions and tech giants are vying for the same minds, creating an environment where talent is the ultimate currency. This development is a stark reminder of the high stakes involved in AI innovation, where the right team can mean the difference between leading the industry and playing catch-up.\n\nWhat makes this particularly fascinating is the broader implications for the industry. As more companies like Meta open their wallets to secure AI experts, we might witness a significant shift in how talent is distributed across the sector. This could potentially lead to a brain drain from academic circles, where groundbreaking research often begins, to the private sector, where commercial applications take flight. While this could accelerate AI advancements, it also raises questions about the future of academic research and its role in shaping technology.\n\nUltimately, this trend underscores a crucial reality: AI technology is not just a field of study but a pivotal component of our future economy and society. As companies increasingly invest in talent, we should keep a close eye on how these moves affect innovation, collaboration, and the balance between profit-driven and academic exploration. There's no denying that the battle for AI talent is reshaping the landscape, and the ripple effects could redefine how we think about technology and its potential."

    "rearview_notes_1": "Here is the article:\n\"\"\"\nIntroducing 11ai: the voice-first AI assistant that takes action\nJun 23, 2025 \u2022 5 minutes reading time\nAuthors\nSmiling young man with short hair in a black polo shirt, black and white photo.\nLouis Jordan, Engineering\nToday, we\u2019re launching 11.ai (alpha) - a voice assistant built to explore the potential of ElevenLabs Conversational AI technology.\n\nIntroducing 11.ai personal voice assistants\n\nOn this page\n\nIntroduction\nVoice-first productivity\nMCP integration\nPowered by ElevenLabs Conversational AI\nGetting started with 11ai\nTry 11.ai\n11.ai demonstrates what is possible when you combine voice-first interaction with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to give an AI assistant the ability to take action.\n\nVoice assistants have long promised to revolutionize how we interact with technology, but they've been limited to answering questions. While impressive for conversation, they don't take meaningful action in your daily workflow.\n\nIntroducing 11ai\n\nVoice-first productivity\nTraditional voice assistants face limitations when it comes to actually accomplishing something meaningful. They can answer questions but can\u2019t research new findings based on supplied data. 11ai is our foray intro addressing this by connecting directly to the tools you use everyday through MCP integration.\n\nHere's what you might be able to accomplish with just your voice:\n\nMorning planning:\n\n\"Plan my day and add my priority tasks to Linear\"\n\nCustomer research:\n\n\"Use Perplexity to research our prospect meeting today and summarize their recent funding\"\n\nProject management:\n\n\"Search our Linear issues for the API bug and create a new ticket for the follow-up work\"\n\nTeam communication:\n\n\"Catch me up on yesterday's Slack messages in the engineering channel\"\n\n11ai attempts to understand context across your tools and take sequential actions. When you ask it to research a customer, the goal is for it to search through your connected systems, find relevant data, and potentially act on that information by updating your CRM or sending a team update.\n\nMCP integration\nMCP provides a standardized way for AI assistants to integrate with external APIs with a uniform protocol. \n\nElevenLabs Conversational AI now also has built-in support for MCP \u2014 letting AI agents connect to services like Salesforce, HubSpot, Gmail, Zapier and more seamlessly.\n\nWe provide out-of-the-box integrations for:\n\nPerplexity: Research capabilities with real-time web data\nLinear: Issue tracking and project management\nSlack: Team communication and message management\nNotion: Task and knowledge management\nwith more integrations being released every week.\n\nBeyond these ready-made integrations, 11ai supports custom MCP servers. If your team has built internal tools or uses specialized software, you can connect your own MCP servers to extend 11ai's capabilities into your unique workflow.\n\nGetting started with 11ai\n\nThe MCP architecture ensures that all connections are secure and that 11ai only has access to the specific actions you've authorized. Each integration can be configured with appropriate permissions, giving you full control over what your AI assistant can and cannot do.\n\nPowered by ElevenLabs Conversational AI\n11ai serves as a proof of concept showcasing what developers can build with ElevenLabs Conversational AI, our low-latency platform for creating scalable voice agents. This demonstration shows how the underlying technology can be used to create sophisticated voice-first applications with real-world integrations.\n\nKey platform features include:\n\nUltra-low latency: Real-time conversation with minimal delay\nMultimodal support: Voice and text interaction in the same session\nIntegrated RAG: Access to external knowledge bases with context-aware responses\nAutomatic language detection: Seamless multilingual conversations\nEnterprise-ready: HIPAA compliance and enterprise-grade security\n11ai demonstrates how these capabilities combine to create natural, productive voice interactions. The platform handles the complex orchestration of speech processing, intent understanding, tool integration, and response generation \u2014 all while maintaining the conversational flow that makes voice interaction feel natural.\n\nYou can choose from over 5,000 voices in our library or create a custom voice clone that sounds like you. This personalization makes your AI assistant feel like a natural extension of your workflow rather than a generic bot.\n\nGetting started with 11ai\n11ai is available as a proof of concept in alpha starting today. During this experimental phase, we're offering free access to help us gather feedback and demonstrate the potential of voice-first AI assistants.\n\nTo get started:\n\nSign up at 11.ai: Create your account and complete the setup process\nChoose your voice: Select from our library of 5,000+ voices or create a custom voice clone\nConnect your tools: Add integrations for Google Calendar, Linear, Slack, Perplexity, and any custom MCP servers\nStart your first conversation: Try basic workflows like planning your day or researching a topic\nDuring the alpha period, we're particularly interested in feedback about:\n\nWhich integrations are most valuable for your workflow\nWhat additional MCP servers you'd like to see supported natively\nHow the voice interaction feels compared to traditional interfaces\nWhat new capabilities would make 11ai essential for your daily routine\nAs we gather feedback and iterate on the platform, we'll be adding new integrations, improving the conversation flow, and expanding the actions 11ai can take on your behalf.\n\nAs a proof of concept, 11ai demonstrates our vision for the future of human-computer interaction: natural conversation that results in meaningful action. We're excited to see how you experiment with voice-first productivity and what possibilities it opens for your workflows.\n\"\"\"",
